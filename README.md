# GeorgetownCrimeAnalysis

This repo contains the code and output for the Georgetown Certificate in Data Science capstone project related to analysis of crime data.

The [Data folder](https://github.com/jacobpstein/GeorgetownCrimeAnalysis/tree/main/01%20data) contains data files for analysis.

The [Archive folder](https://github.com/jacobpstein/GeorgetownCrimeAnalysis/tree/main/05%20archive) contains old files and drafts that might still have value as a reference.

Additional files and folders will be added as the project proceeds.
