Cohort 28 Capstone Project for the Certificate of Data Science at Georgetown University School of Continuing Studies.

The [Data folder](https://github.com/jacobpstein/GeorgetownCrimeAnalysis/tree/main/01%20data) contains data files for analysis.

The [Code folder](https://github.com/jacobpstein/GeorgetownCrimeAnalysis/tree/main/02%20code) is where we will post our python scripts.

The [Output folder](https://github.com/jacobpstein/GeorgetownCrimeAnalysis/tree/main/03%20output) will contain our analytical results.

The [Viz folder](https://github.com/jacobpstein/GeorgetownCrimeAnalysis/tree/main/04%20viz) will have final data visualizations for reporting.

The [Archive folder](https://github.com/jacobpstein/GeorgetownCrimeAnalysis/tree/main/05%20archive) contains old files and drafts that might still have value as a reference.

Additional files and folders will be added as the project proceeds.
